## 🔑 Key Differences Between Hashing and Encryption

| Feature               | **Hashing**                                          | **Encryption**                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**           | **Data integrity verification**                      | **Data confidentiality & protection**          |
| **Reversibility**     | ❌ **One-way** – Cannot be reversed                   | ✅ **Two-way** – Can be decrypted with a key    |
| **Output Size**       | Fixed-length (e.g., SHA-256 → 256 bits)              | Variable – depends on input and algorithm used |
| **Key Used?**         | 🚫 No key involved                                   | 🔑 Requires a key (symmetric or asymmetric)    |
| **Typical Use Cases** | Password storage, file integrity, digital signatures | Messaging, secure file storage, HTTPS, VPNs    |
| **Deterministic?**    | ✅ Always same hash for same input                    | 🔁 Often uses random IVs for the same input    |
| **Examples**          | SHA-1, SHA-256, MD5                                  | AES, RSA, DES, ChaCha20                        |

## 🧠 Real-Life Analogies

### ✅ **Hashing** = Fingerprint

* You can take a file, get its hash, and later check if it changed (integrity).
* You **cannot get the original file** from the fingerprint (hash).

### 🔐 **Encryption** = Locked Box

* You put a message in, lock it with a key.
* The receiver can **unlock** it with the correct key (decryption).

## 🔁 One-Way vs Two-Way

| Operation       | Hashing                 | Encryption            |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Input           | `"secret"`              | `"secret"`            |
| Output          | `e.g., 5ebe...` (fixed) | `Encrypted gibberish` |
| Can reverse it? | ❌ No                    | ✅ Yes                 |

## 🔐 Use Case Examples

| Task                        | Use...                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Storing passwords securely  | ✅ **Hashing** (with salt) |
| Sending secure emails       | ✅ **Encryption**          |
| Checking file tampering     | ✅ **Hashing**             |
| Protecting credit card info | ✅ **Encryption**          |

## 🚨 Important Security Note

* 🔒 **Passwords should NEVER be encrypted** and stored — always **hashed with salt**.
* 🔁 **Sensitive data like files, messages, and keys** should be **encrypted**, not hashed.
